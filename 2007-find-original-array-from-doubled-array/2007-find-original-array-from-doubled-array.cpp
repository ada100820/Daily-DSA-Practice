/*
Intuition:
--> Since we need to return an original array if changed is a doubled array. If changed is not a doubled array, return
    an empty array. The elements in original may be returned in any order, so we first sort the array.
--> Since we have sorted the array, so we will find the twice of a number, If we get it, well and good, check further,
    else return {}

Approach:
--> First we take a map, then we sort the given array changed.
--> We keep removing the smallest element n and 2 * n and keep putting n into the answer until changed array becomes
    empty.
--> If at anytime the we are unable to remove elements we return empty array.
--> Time Complexity: O(NLogN)
--> Space Complexity: O(N)

/*
Intuition:
Since we need to return number of weak characters and a character is said to be weak if any other character has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than this character's attack and defense levels, so we need to implement a custom sort here so that we can handle both the cases out here.

Approach:
--> We sort the properties by the first element i.e attack( High->Low)
--> So now we need to handle the second element only i.e defense.
--> Iterate through the back and use a variable maxTillNow to store the maximum defense we saw till now.
--> If at any point the current defense is smaller than the maxTillNow it clearly means that we have a property with
    both attack and defense greater than the current property so we can increase our ans else we just update our
    maxTillNow.

--> Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
--> Space Complexity: O(1)
